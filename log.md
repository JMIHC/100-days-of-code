Day 1: January 4, 2016

Today's Progress: Worked on Title Case a Sentence, not yet complete

Thoughts: I'm starting to think that the way to title case a sentence lies in the slice method.

Day 3: January 5, 2016

Today's Progress: Working on finding the largest number in an array. Also, day two wasn't submitted as a log. But I had continued to work on day 1's algorithm.

Thoughts: Thinking about solving all of the algorithm problems in both javascript and swift. Is that too much? Nah.
